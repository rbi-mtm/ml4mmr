    "## Finding Novel Garnet Substrates for YIG Spintronics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will try identify novel garnet substrates suitable for **Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG)** spintronics applications. YIG is an important material in research for spintronic devices due to its exceptional magnetic properties. However, finding compatible metallic substrates remains a significant challenge. We are looking for a new metallic garnet whose lattice closely matches the YIG lattice constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal substrate must be:\n",
    "- **Thermodynamically and dynamically stable**, i.e. close to the convex hull and free of imaginary phonon modes  \n",
    "- **Reasonably safe to work with** in terms of elemental composition  \n",
    "- **Lattice-matched** to YIG to optimize epitaxial growth  \n",
    "- **Metallic** or possess a **small band gap**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will construct a computational pipeline that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Database Mining  \n",
    "   Use the OPTIMADE API to search crystal-structure repositories for garnets. This leverages existing calculations and also allows us to validate the rest of our workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. - Generate new garnet compositions via a combinatorial approach.  \n",
    "   - Relax each candidate using Atomate2 workflows to evaluate thermodynamic stability.  \n",
    "   - For any promising, low-energy structures, evaluate dynamic stability (e.g., phonon calculations).  \n",
    "   - Employ universal machine-learning force fields as a DFT surrogate to accelerate relaxation, given the large unit cell of garnets.  \n",
    "   - Then apply a second set of machine-learning models to predict the band gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rank all candidates based on thermodynamic stability, lattice matching, and band gap.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While we will not explore hundreds of thousands of candidates we will make sure that the pipeline will automatically scale to this number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding how to access and query materials databases using the OPTIMADE standard."

    "# Introduction to OPTIMADE\n",
    "In materials research, data is scattered across numerous experimental and theoretical databases maintained by different institutions.\n",
    "Example theoretical databases that host inorganic crystal structures are:\n",
    "- Materials Project\n",
    "- Alexandria\n",
    "- AFLOW\n",
    "- OQMD (Open Quantum Materials Database)\n",
    "- NOMAD\n",
    "- And many others\n",
    "\n",
    "OPTIMADE solves the \"database fragmentation\" problem by allowing you to:\n",
    "- Query multiple databases using the same syntax\n",
    "- Retrieve data in a consistent format\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is OPTIMADE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**Open Databases Integration for Materials Design (OPTIMADE)**](https://www.optimade.org/) is a standardized API specification that enables access to materials databases from different providers. Instead of learning different query languages and data formats for each database, OPTIMADE provides a unified interface to search across multiple materials science repositories. Once a workflow is established for one database it can easily be extended to multiple databases such as in [Accelerating the discovery of high-performance nonlinear optical materials using active learning and high-throughput screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01526).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structures**: The primary entries in most OPTIMADE databases, representing crystal structures with properties like:\n",
    "- Chemical composition\n",
    "- Lattice parameters\n",
    "- Atomic positions\n",
    "\n",
    "One weakness at the moment is that other properties such as band gaps usually have database specific names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning: While Optimade provides a common interface the calculation parameters of most databases are not compatible! Even quantities such as space groups might be calculated using different tolerances.**\n",

   "source": [
    "The power of OPTIMADE lies in its ability to query multiple databases simultaneously. In principle, we can directly query all available databases with a single command, as shown in the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from optimade.client import OptimadeClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the OPTIMADE client\n",
    "client = OptimadeClient()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query all databases for structures \n",
    "results = client.get('elements HAS \"Li\" AND nelements=2') #containing Li, with 2 different elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach would systematically search through all 59 million crystal structures hosted by the 27 [OPTIMADE-compliant databases](https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard/) and return structures containing Lithium and one other element. The query filters are written in an SQL-like synthax.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, querying all available databases simultaneously comes with practical limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: A comprehensive search across all databases can take several hours depending on the query complexity\n",
    "- **Rate limiting**: Different databases have varying rate limits and response times\n",
    "- **Network reliability**: Some databases may be temporarily unavailable, affecting the completeness of results\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will limit ourselves to a few of the largest providers with open licenses:\n",
