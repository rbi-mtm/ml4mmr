    "  1. **Monitor for Common Errors**: Parse the DFT output for known failure modes (e.g. incorrect smearing, frozen jobs, ...).  \n",
    "  2. **Apply Automatic Fixes**: Modify INCAR or other input parameters (increase `ALGO`, switch to a different `PREC`, adjust `EDIFF`) and restart the calculation.  \n",
    "  3. **Check output for correctness**: E.g. too large errors in the final energy due to smearing\n",

    "  2. **DFT Input Generation**: Creating VASP input sets (INCAR, POSCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS) with standardized parameters (e.g., recommended pseudopotentials, convergence criteria, Hubbard U for transition metals).  \n",
