    "# 🧠 Notebook 2: Loading Pretrained ML Models — SchNet and PaiNN\n",
    "## Making predictions for all geometries on the 2D grid\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we load two pretrained machine learning models that have been trained to predict **multiple adiabatic potential energy surfaces** and **non-adiabatic couplings** for $\\mathrm{CH_2NH_2^+}$. These models are based on two state-of-the-art neural network architectures: **SchNet** and **PaiNN**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔷 SchNet\n",
    "\n",
    "**SchNet** is one of the earliest deep learning architectures tailored for atomistic systems. It uses continuous-filter convolutional layers to model interactions between atoms based on their distances, making it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invariant to rotations and translations**,\n",
    "- **Suitable for scalar properties** like energies and forces,\n",
    "- Trained directly on atomic positions and nuclear charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SchNet does **not** explicitly encode directional (vectorial) information, which can be a limitation when learning vector-valued quantities like **non-adiabatic couplings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔷 PaiNN\n",
    "\n",
    "**PaiNN** (Polarizable Atom Interaction Neural Network) builds on the SchNet paradigm but **adds equivariant features**: it includes both scalar and vector features and uses operations that are **equivariant under 3D rotations**. This makes PaiNN especially well-suited for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting **vector-valued properties** (e.g., dipole moments, NACs),\n",
    "- Preserving rotational symmetry while still encoding orientation-dependent interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: PaiNN knows how to “feel” directionality, while SchNet treats the system more like a set of interatomic distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧰 What We’ll Do in This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the pretrained SchNet and PaiNN models,\n",
    "- Apply them to a set of molecular geometries,\n",
    "- Extract predicted **energies** and **non-adiabatic couplings** for the lowest few singlet states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models were trained on the 4000 MRCI data points published in: Chem. Sci., 2019, 10, 8100, DOI: [10.1039/c9sc01742a](https:doi.org/10.1039/c9sc01742a)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to compare how both models represent the electronic structure of $\\mathrm{CH_2NH_2^+}$, and explore where their predictions agree—and where they might differ.\n"

    "### 🔧 SpaiNN: Machine-Learned Excited-State Dynamics with SHARC\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use **SpaiNN**, a specialized interface that adapts **PaiNN** models for use in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. SpaiNN, like the SchNarc interface for SchNet models, is designed to bridge **machine learning models** with **excited-state dynamics tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of SpaiNN is to provide an **ASE-style calculator** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads models trained with **schnetpack-style** infrastructure,\n",
    "- Converts predictions (energies, forces, and non-adiabatic couplings) into standard **ASE `Atoms` properties**,\n",
    "- Makes it possible to integrate ML-based predictions seamlessly into molecular dynamics workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup enables full compatibility with ASE-based tools and, importantly, with **PySHARC**—the new Python-based interface for the **SHARC** (Surface Hopping including ARbitrary Couplings) dynamics engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the older SHARC versions, **PySHARC** avoids file-based communication wherever possible. This makes it especially suitable for coupling with **ML models**, where predictions are computed rapidly and do not rely on disk I/O. The SpaiNN interface is thus a key component for running **efficient, on-the-fly nonadiabatic dynamics** powered entirely by ML potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on **loading a pretrained SpaiNN model** and demonstrate how it can be used to make predictions in a form directly usable by ASE and PySHARC.\n",
