    "### Loading model checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to sample stable structures with a particular space group (e.g., 225). Here, we load a conditional model checkpoint (called `space_group`) from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/mattergen) and use the model for sampling. The model has been pre-trained on a large number of stable structures and fine-tuned on a labeled set of structures with space group labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **speed up sampling**, we will reduce the number of denoising steps from 1000 to 100. This will result in lower quality samples, but will allow us to generate samples ~10x faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we are **preventing the model from generating certain elements** (e.g., radioactive ones) by explicitly setting the logits of the model's element predictions to `-inf` for these elements. While the model should have learned to avoid these elements during training, it may still accidentally generate them."

For example, predicting synthesizability is still an open research problem. Thus, we resort to predicting thermodynamic stability at 0K as a proxy. Likewise, we use uniqueness as a proxy for diversity.\n",
