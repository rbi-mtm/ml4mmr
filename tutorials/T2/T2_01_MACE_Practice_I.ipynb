    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to fit and test a `MACE` model, which is a highly accurate and efficient MLIP (Machine Learning Interatomic Potential). The training/testing techniques we show here, however, are broadly applicable to all MLIPs. You can independently learn about MACE by studying the [original method paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/4a36c3c51af11ed9f34615b81edb5bbc-Paper-Conference.pdf). MACE was developed by unifying the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) approach with the Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP). The mathematical formalism which unifies these methods is explained in the [accompaning paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.06643). Another [useful reference](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.14247) showcases the method's performance on published benchmark datasets. The [code implementation](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace) is publically available and [here](https://mace-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) you can find the documentation. This notebook was made by Ioan Magdău and Ilyes Batatia and Will Baldwin.\n",

    "    An alternative way to choose the validation set is by using the `--valid_fraction` keyword. These data configs are used to estimate the model accuracy during training, but not for parameter optimization. The validation set also controls the stopping of the training. At each `--eval_interval` the model is tested on the validation set. The evaluation of these configs takes place in batches, which can be controlled by `--valid_batch_size`. If the accuracy of the model stops improving on the validation set for `--patience` number of epochs, the model will undergo **early stopping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--test_file`: name of testing dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    This set is entirely independent and only gets evaluated at the end of the training process to estimate the model accuracy on an independent set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--E0s`: isolated atom energies\n",
    "\n",
    "    Controls how `E0s` should be determined. The strongly recommended approach is to add these values to the training set with `config_type=IsolatedAtom` in `atoms.info` and set `E0s=\"isolated\"`. If these values are not available, MACE can estimate them by least square regression over the available data `E0s=\"average\"` which can lead to unintended consequences depending on how representative the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--energy_key, --forces_key` the key where these values are stores\n",
    "    This key must coincide with the `ase.Atoms.info[key]/ase.Atoms.arrays[key]` where the energies and forces are stored in the ase.Atoms object. **It is very important to get them right**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--device` computing device to use\n",
    "    Can be CPU (`cpu`), GPU (`cuda`) or Apple Silicon (`mps`). Here we will use `cuda` since the GPU will be significantly faster than the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--batch_size` number of configs evaluated in one batch\n",
    "    Number of configs used to compute the gradients for each full update of the network parameters. This training strategy is called stochastic gradient descent because only a subset of the data (`batch_size`) is used to change the parameters at each update.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--max_num_epochs` number of passes through the data\n",
    "    An `epoch` is completed when the entire training data has been used once in updating the weights `batch` by `batch`. A new epoch begins, and the process repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--swa` protocol for loss weights\n",
    "    During training you will notice energy errors are at first much higher than force errors, MACE implements a special protocol that increases the weight on the energy in the loss function (`--swa_energy_weight`) once the forces are sufficiently accurate. The starting epoch for this special protocol can be controlled by changing `--start_swa`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### `--seed` random number generator seed\n",
